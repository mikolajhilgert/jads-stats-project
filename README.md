# JBP061-B-6 Statistics for Data Scientists 2023
The following assignment description was given as part of the Statistics for Data Scientists course as part of the JADS pre-master:

The purpose of this analysis is to evaluate the data from the top 1000 Twitch streamers from the year 2020 in order to make strategic recommendations for a content creator looking to make a start on the platform. The up-and-coming streamer has expressed their considerations and wants to leverage the tools of statistics to make well informed decisions, such that they can model their journey based on the successes of top creators. As such the following main questions will be evaluated and discussed throughout the document:

1. Should there be a focus on mature content (18+) audience? What are the consequences one decides to do so in terms of the reaction of the audience?

2. Does such a focus on mature content lower or increase the chance of becoming a Twitch partner?

3. Is the effect of the stream time larger or smaller in mature content?
